# Notethread v1.5 Journal 

The goal of this release is to attempt to get tags into play.

## 25/04/2012

There are a few major decisions I need to make.

* How will a user add tags in?
* What are the purpose of tags?

*How will a user add tags in?*
I'm considering that I can utilise the twitter keyboard layout. It has the hash key
built in. The major hurdle after that is getting a keyboard event to load existing 
hashes appropriately. This is something I have struggled with in the past. 

*What are the purpose of tags?*
To me they're a way for fast categorisation of notes. You make notes disparately in 
various threads. Tags are a way of linking them together. This has spawned the notion
of making tags into lists. 

I could present another option in the bottom toolbar for users to access lists. This is
dynamically generated by loading up all the tags. Then they will just be presented in a
table view. Nothing special on that front.

It seems to me that people may want to use Notethread in different ways. I don't want to
force it to be a TODO app; nor do I want to restrict that functionality either... 

The intention of the app was to create better organised notes. 

Tags add another dimension without sacrificing the core functionality. There is no break
in how the app works. Perhaps a bad decision? Who knows; but it's the direction I think
it should go. Plus the source code is out there for anyone to change.

### Work log

Updating the version and removing Release-Goals. I don't update it anymore so it's a bit
useless having it there. Adding this development journal instead.
