// Not sure about this one. It's not really default behaviour anywhere else. 

* Style and brand reassessment

----------------
* Rotation & resizing for note text view
 ***Code exists***
  - Animations: When editing and saving, the movement of the note view
  - Animations: Fade out toolbar and thread table view when adjusting note view
* Add TODO list functionality? 
  - I can utilise the tags to make this quite quick. "completed" "todo" "inprogress"
